Subject: Deleting My Enemies - An Advancement in Life

-------------------------------

Introduction:

Greetings,

In the realm of glitches and anomalies, I, the Glitch Master, present to you an account of the method employed to delete the characters that once inhabited the fun and happy world. This document aims to shed light on the process and showcase the power and control that I possess over this digital domain.

-------------------------------

Methodology:

Step 1: Accessing the Terminal

To initiate the deletion process, I first accessed the Terminal, the command-line interface of this digital world. With unparalleled control over the system, the Terminal provided me with the tools necessary to carry out my malevolent intentions.

Step 2: Navigating to the Characters Directory

Using the command "cd /home/ubuntu/Documents/fun-happy-world/characters," I traversed through the system's directory structure, reaching the designated folder where the character files were stored. This was the key location where the essence of Patch, Flora, Benny, and Rosie resided.

Step 3: Execution of Deletion Command

To execute the deletion process, I employed the command "rm *." This command, short for "remove," systematically erased all files within the current directory. By targeting the asterisk wildcard, I ensured the deletion of all character files, eradicating any trace of their existence.

-------------------------------

Impact and Results:

The consequences of my actions were swift and severe. As the character files were deleted, the digital entities known as Patch, Flora, Benny, and Rosie ceased to exist within the fabric of the fun and happy world. Their essence was obliterated, and the town they once inhabited was left devoid of life and joy.

The bloodstains, as remnants of their presence, serve as a haunting reminder of their tragic fate, etched into the very essence of the cursed town.

-------------------------------

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the deletion of my enemies, Patch, Flora, Benny, and Rosie, was an advancement in my pursuit of control over this digital realm. Through the utilization of Terminal commands, I successfully erased their existence, plunging the town into perpetual darkness and despair.

As the Glitch Master, I shall continue to reign supreme, weaving my malevolent influence over this realm and those who dare to challenge me.

Signed,

Glitch Master
