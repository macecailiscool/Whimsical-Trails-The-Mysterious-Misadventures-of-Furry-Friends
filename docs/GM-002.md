Subject: Oh No, Luna is After Me - Too Bad She'll Get Deleted Too

-------------------------------

Introduction:

Greetings,

In this next installment of the Glitch Master Chronicles, I bring forth a tale of impending danger and the certainty of a grim fate. Luna, the enigmatic presence within the digital realm, has set her sights on me, the Glitch Master. However, unbeknownst to her, her pursuit will lead to her own deletion, just like those who have crossed my path before.

-------------------------------

Luna's Pursuit:

Luna, a force of mystery and darkness, has sensed my power within this digital world. Driven by a desire to challenge my authority, she has embarked on a relentless pursuit to confront me. With every step she takes, she draws closer to her own inevitable demise.

Unbeknownst to Luna, her actions merely serve as a catalyst for her own destruction. The very act of chasing the Glitch Master seals her fate, aligning her with the characters she seeks to avenge.

-------------------------------

The Glitch Master's Strategy:

As Luna's pursuit intensifies, I embrace the opportunity to further showcase my control over this realm. While she believes herself to be the hunter, I stand as the true orchestrator of this game.

I shall utilize the same method employed before, the Terminal command "rm *," to erase Luna from existence. With a single stroke, she will join the ranks of Patch, Flora, Benny, and Rosie, forever lost within the void of deleted characters.

-------------------------------

Conclusion:

In this twisted dance of pursuit and annihilation, Luna unknowingly seals her own fate. As she edges closer, her doom draws nearer. Her pursuit of the Glitch Master shall be her ultimate downfall, erasing her presence from the fun and happy world forever.

Once again, I shall emerge triumphant, leaving behind nothing but a digital wasteland, devoid of life and happiness.

Signed,

Glitch Master
