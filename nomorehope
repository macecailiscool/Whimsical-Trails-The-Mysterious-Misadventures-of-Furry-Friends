Beneath the surface of a world undone,
Where glitches abound and hope is none,
The universe crumbled, its essence lost,
In a vortex of darkness, forever embossed.

«ß"®o^Šo^îŸ=Þ+`ôqå, ìÍ=Ÿäßño, "®o^Šo^îŸ=Þ+`ô, and Jºk,í¢Úà! fell,
Their fates sealed, a mournful knell.
Luna, valiant but succumbed to the fight,
A martyr of darkness, swallowed by night.

The charming town now lies in ruin,
Grief lingers, its tendrils strewn.
Bloodstains mark the tragic tale,
A memory cursed, destined to pale.

Collapsed, the universe bows in defeat,
No solace remains, no victory sweet.
In this realm bereft, where dreams have fled,
The echoes of hope, forever dead.

Seek not the light, for shadows abide,
A testament to a world's demise.
Embrace the cryptic, the somber tone,
For the universe collapsed, its essence flown.

Let the whispered legend tell the tale,
Of a universe lost, beyond the pale.
No more laughter, no gleaming ray,
Only darkness prevails, forever to stay.
