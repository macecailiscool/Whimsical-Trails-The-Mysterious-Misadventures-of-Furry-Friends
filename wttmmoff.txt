PIECE 1:

Once upon a time in a charming little town, there lived a group of adorable animal friends. There was Patch, the curious puppy, who loved exploring the meadows, and Flora, the graceful fawn, who frolicked through the forest with elegance. They were joined by Benny, the mischievous squirrel, who always managed to find the tastiest acorns, and Rosie, the wise old owl, who watched over them with a gentle wisdom.

Every day, the four friends would embark on exciting adventures together. They would chase butterflies, build cozy nests, and share stories under the twinkling night sky. Their innocent laughter filled the air, as they reveled in the joy of their companionship.

Then one day, everyone disappeared without a trace... The only evidence left of anybody even existing was the leftover blood of the characters that had disappeared.
